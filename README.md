# **Palindrome Detector**

## Instructions

### How Nim Works

<br>

- A palindrome is a string that reads the same both forward and backward. Examples of palindromes are "radar", "31413", and "abc a cba". Write a boolean-valued method `isPalindrome` that has a single String parameter. The method should return true if and only if its parameter is a palindrome. 



## Objective
---


- Write a program that reads a string and then prints if the string is a palindrome or not. 

- Has In.java
- Used Java version 1.2 ~~(*is updated though*)~~
