# **Fractions Calculator**

## Instructions
---

Write a program that will perform the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on pairs of fractions, producing answers in standard fractional form. Specifically, your program should repeatedly perform the following actions.

- Read a character representing an operation. This will be one of the characters +, -, *, /, or $. The $ signals the end of the data; reading it should cause the program to terminate.
- Read four integers representing the numerator and denominator of a first fraction followed by the numerator and denominator of a second fraction.
-Perform the indicated operation and print the results in the appropriate form as illustrated in the examples that follow

In the examples, the input is shown on one line. The program, however, should read the input items one at a time, with each one on a separate line.
```
1. Input: + 1 3 -19 -8 
   Output: 1/3 + -19/-8 = 2 and 17/24
2. Input: / 2 -5 3 -7 
   Output: 2/-5 / 3/-7 = 14/15
3. Input: - 5 2 1 2 
   Output: 5/2 – ½ = 2
```
Notice that improper fractions should be written as mixed numbers, as in (a), and integer results should be written as, as in (c). It is not, however, necessary to reduce fractions to lowest terms. The program should assume that a user will provide integers when required but it should not assume that the integers will produce valid results. For example, bad data such as

` + 3 5 4 0` --> 0 in the denominator should be classified as an error

This should be detected by the program. In such cases, the program should write an error message and then continue to process the next set of data.
